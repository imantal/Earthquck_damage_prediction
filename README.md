# Earthquck_damage_prediction
The project inlcude a multi-class supervised learning problem to predict the damage classification of buildings as a result of the Gorkha earthquake in Nepal in April 2015. The Gorkha earthquake was 7.8 in magnitude and occured near the Gorkha district of Gandaki Pradesh, Nepal. Almost 9,000 lives were lost, millions of people were instantly made homeless, and $10 billion in damages about half of Nepal's nominal GDP was incurred.

The database used for our project is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected. The dataset icnlude more than 760,000 buildings inspected after the earthqauke. The entry for ecah building contains valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics. The target variable is damage garde and it has 5 classes, labelled 'Grade 1':'Grade 5' which each represent the different scale of damage sustained to the building.

We have clenated teh data, and removed the outliers for ecah feature. We have decided which features to keep for prediction. A numbers of methods including Nueral network and random forrest classifier were used to predict the earthqauke damage and compare with actual recorded damge.
